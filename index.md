## Introduction

Markdown is a simple plain text formatting language for writing text for
the web. Instead of writing HTML by hand, which is error-prone and time
consulming, many web sites and other tools offer Markdown.

Markdown is commonly used by web sites such as [GitHub][], [Reddit][],
[Discourse][], web site building tools, as well as readme files and
other documentation.

## Common syntax

### Headers

The standard syntax for headers is this:

~~~
# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6
~~~

The output would look like this:

~~~
<h1>h1</h1>
<h2>h2</h2>
<h3>h3</h3>
<h4>h4</h4>
<h5>h5</h5>
<h6>h6</h6>
~~~
