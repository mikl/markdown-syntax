## Introduction

Markdown is a simple plain text formatting language for writing text for
the web. Instead of writing HTML by hand, which is error-prone and time
consulming, many web sites and other tools offer Markdown.

Markdown is commonly used by web sites such as [GitHub][], [Reddit][],
[Discourse][], web site building tools, as well as readme files and
other documentation.
